/**
 * The class UEventsHandler is an abstract class for
 * handling events.
 *
 * Inherited classes must implement handleEvent() function, which
 * is called by the UEventsManager when an event is dispatched. Once the handler is
 * created, it must be added to events manager with UEventsManager::addHandler() function.
 * Note that it is not safe to automatically add the handler to UEventsManager in the handler's constructor.
 *
 * Note for multi-threading: the handleEvent() method is called
 * inside the UEventsManager thread. If the inherited class also inherits
 * from UThreadNode, handleEvent() is done as well outside the thread's main loop, so
 * be careful to protect private data of the thread used in its main loop.
 *
 * Example for a useful combination of an UEventsHandler and a UThreadNode, with safe data
 * modification while not blocking the handleEvent() call on a mutex:
 * @code
 * #include "utilite/UThreadNode.h"
 * #include "utilite/UEventsHandler.h"
 * #include "utilite/UEventsManager.h"
 * #include "utilite/UEvent.h"
 *
 * // Implement a simple event
 * class ResetEvent : public UEvent {
 * public:
 *    ResetEvent() {}
 *    virtual ~ResetEvent() {}
 *    virtual std::string getClassName() const {return "ResetEvent";} // Must be implemented
 * };
 *
 * // There is the thread counting indefinitely, the count can be reseted by sending a ResetEvent.
 * class CounterThread : public UThreadNode, public UEventsHandler {
 * public:
 *    CounterThread() : state_(0), count_(0) {}
 *    virtual ~CounterThread() {this->join(true);}
 *
 * protected:
 *    virtual void mainLoop() {
 *       if(state_ == 1) {
 *          state_ = 0;
 *          // Do a long initialization, reset memory or other special long works... here
 *          // we reset the count. This could be done in the handleEvent() but
 *          // with many objects, it is more safe to do it here (in the thread's loop). A safe
 *          // way could be also to use a UMutex to protect this initialization in
 *          // the handleEvent(), but it is not recommended to do long works in handleEvent()
 *          // because this will add latency in the UEventsManager dispatching events loop.
 *          count_ = 0; // Reset the count
 *          printf("Reset!\n");
 *       }
 *
 *       // Do some works...
 *       printf("count=%d\n", count_++);
 *       uSleep(100); // wait 100 ms
 *    }
 *    virtual void handleEvent(UEvent * event) {
 *       if(event->getClassName().compare("ResetEvent") == 0) {
 *          state_ = 1;
 *       }
 *    }
 * private:
 *    int state_;
 *    int count_;
 * };
 *
 * int main(int argc, char * argv[])
 * {
 *    CounterThread counter;
 *    counter.start();
 *    UEventsManager::addHandler(&counter);
 *
 *    uSleep(500); // wait 500 ms before sending a reset event
 *    UEventsManager::post(new ResetEvent());
 *    uSleep(500); // wait 500 ms before termination
 *
 *    UEventsManager::removeHandler(&counter);
 *    counter.join(true); // Kill and wait to finish
 *    return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The output is:
 * @code
 * count=0
 * count=1
 * count=2
 * count=3
 * count=4
 * Reset!
 * count=0
 * count=1
 * count=2
 * count=3
 * count=4
 * @endcode
