/**
 * The class UThread is an abstract class for creating thread objects.
 * A UThread provides methods to create threads as an object-style fashion.
 *
 * For most of inherited classes, only mainLoop() needs to be implemented, then only start() needs
 * to be called from the outside.
 * The main loop is called until the thread itself calls kill() or another thread
 * calls kill() or join() (with parameter to true) on this thread. Unlike kill(), join() is a blocking call:
 * the calling thread will wait until this thread has finished, thus join() must not be
 * called inside the mainLoop().
 *
 * If inside the mainLoop(), at some time, the thread needs to wait on a mutex/semaphore
 * (like for the acquisition of a resource), the function mainLoopKill() should be
 * implemented to release the mutex/semaphore when the thread is killed, to avoid a deadlock.
 * The function killCleanup() is called after the thread's state is set to kSKilled.
 * After the mutex/semaphore is released in killCleanup(), on wake up, the thread can know if
 * it needs to stop by calling isKilled().
 *
 * To do an initialization process (executed by the worker thread) just one time before
 * entering the mainLoop(), mainLoopBegin() can be implemented.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * #include "utilite/UThread.h"
 * class SimpleThread : public UThread
 * {
 * public:
 * 	SimpleThread() {}
 * 	virtual ~SimpleThread() {
 * 		// The calling thread will wait until this thread has finished.
 * 		this->join(true);
 *	}
 *
 * protected:
 * 	virtual void mainLoop() {
 * 		// Do some works...
 *
 * 		// This will stop the thread, otherwise the mainLoop() is recalled.
 *		this->kill();
 * 	}
 * };
 *
 * int main(int argc, char * argv[])
 * {
 *	SimpleThread t;
 *	t.start();
 *	t.join(); // Wait until the thread has finished.
 * 	return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see start()
 * @see kill()
 * @see join()
 * @see mainLoopBegin()
 * @see mainLoopKill()
 * @see mainLoop()
